= ValidatesCPF

Rails gem to validate CPF

== Install

gem install validates_cpf

== Usage

Lets say you have a model with "cpf" string column that you want to be a valid CPF. Just add this to your model:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates :cpf, :cpf => true
end

== Test

Only Rspec supported at the moment and has shoulda-matchers as dependecy.

=== How?

You should use validates_as_cpf(:attribute) just like any other shoulda matcher.

== Special Thanks

This project is based on brcpfcnpj gem and his intention it to mantain a cleaner code to validate CPF and macros for test it.
